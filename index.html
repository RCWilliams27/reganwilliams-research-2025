  <h1>Entropy on Graphs</h1>

  <p>This site explores the intersection of spectral graph theory and quantum mechanics. Our goal is to better understand how entropy can be modeled using a graph-theoretic approach. We present theoretical concepts, visualizations, and daily notes from our research process.</p>

    <h2>Von Neumann Entropy on Graphs</h2>

      <h3>Our Focus</h3>
      <p>In this project, we use the spectrum of a graph’s Laplacian matrix to calculate von Neumann entropy. We then explore how it reflects a network's structural complexity and disorder. This led us to ask several questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How does the entropy of well-known graphs compare, and how are these differences reflected in their structure?</li>
        <li>Can we break a large graph into parts, calculate entropy for each, and then "glue" the pieces back together to calculate a total entropy value?</li>
        <li>How does entropy change when we rewire a graph’s connections?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>What Is Von Neumann Entropy of Graphs?</h3>
      <p>Von Neumann entropy is a way to measure how complex or “disordered” a graph is by looking at its structure.</p>
      <p><strong>How We Calculate It:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Degree matrix (D):</strong> This matrix shows how many connections each vertex has. Each diagonal entry tells you the number of edges coming out of that vertex.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacency matrix (A):</strong> This matrix shows which vertices are connected. If two vertices share an edge, the matrix entry is 1; if not, it’s 0.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Laplacian matrix (∆) is found by subtracting the adjacency matrix from the degree matrix:<br>
      <code>∆ = D − A</code></p>
      <p>This Laplacian matrix reflects both the individual connections of vertices and the overall structure of the graph. We then analyze the eigenvalues (λ) of ∆ to compute the von Neumann entropy using the formula:<br>
      <code>∑ λ ln λ</code></p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It helps us understand how ordered or random a network is.</li>
        <li>It shows how complex the graph’s connections are.</li>
        <li>It can be used in real-world problems like analyzing social networks, recognizing patterns, or comparing different networks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short, von Neumann entropy gives us a number that tells how complex or disordered a graph is, helping us see patterns and structure in networks.</p>
