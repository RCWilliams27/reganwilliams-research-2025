      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>This site explores the intersection of spectral graph theory and quantum mechanics. Our goal is to understand how entropy can be modeled through graphs by calculating it directly and investigating how operations like rewiring and gluing affect it. We share theoretical concepts, visualizations, and daily notes from our research process.</p>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This summer research project focuses on computing different types of graph entropy and understanding their meaning in both mathematical and physical contexts. We investigate how the structure of graphs can reflect properties of quantum systems.</p>

      <h2>Entropy & Graphs</h2>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>What Is Entropy?</h3>
        <p>Entropy measures uncertainty or disorder in a system. More specifically, entropy reflects the number of different microscopic configurations (microstates) that correspond to the same observable condition (macrostate). Because there are naturally many more disordered configurations than ordered ones, systems evolve from low-entropy (more ordered) states to high-entropy (less ordered) states.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>Why Is It Important?</h3>
        <p>Entropy shows up across many fields of science, helping us understand everything from heat to information to the structure of the universe. There are several main types of entropy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boltzmann Entropy</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Gibbs Entropy</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Shannon Entropy</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Von Neumann Entropy</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <h3>Why Graphs?</h3>
        <p>Many real-world systems, such as epidemics, social networks, the internet, and key physical processes, involve entropy. Measuring this entropy helps us understand and predict their behavior. However, these systems are too complex to model using continuous equations alone. By discretizing these problems and applying linear algebra, we can study them more effectively. Graph theory provides a natural framework: we represent complex systems as networks of vertices and edges, studied via matrices. These matrices capture structural features closely tied to entropy. This graph-based, linear algebra approach forms the foundation of our research into the entropy of networks.</p>

        <h2>Von Neumann Entropy on Graphs</h2>

        <div class="box">
          <h3>Our Focus</h3>
          <p>In this project, we use the spectrum of a graph’s Laplacian matrix to calculate von Neumann entropy. We then explore how it reflects a network's structural complexity and disorder. This led us to ask several questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How does the entropy of well‑known graphs compare, and how are these differences reflected in their structure?</li>
            <li>Can we break a large graph into parts, calculate entropy for each, and then "glue" the pieces back together to calculate a total entropy value?</li>
            <li>How does entropy change when we rewire a graph’s connections?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <h3>What Is Von Neumann Entropy of Graphs?</h3>
          <p>Von Neumann entropy is a way to measure how complex or “disordered” a graph is by looking at its structure.</p>
          <p><strong>How We Calculate It:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Degree matrix (D):</strong> This matrix shows how many connections each vertex has. Each diagonal entry tells you the number of edges coming out of that vertex.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjacency matrix (A):</strong> This matrix shows which vertices are connected. If two vertices share an edge, the matrix entry is 1; if not, it’s 0.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Laplacian matrix (∆) is found by subtracting the adjacency matrix from the degree matrix:<br>
          ∆ = D − A</p>
          <p>This Laplacian matrix reflects both the individual connections of vertices and the overall structure of the graph. We then analyze the eigenvalues (λ) of ∆ to compute the von Neumann entropy using the formula:<br>
          ∑ λ ln λ</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It helps us understand how ordered or random a network is.</li>
            <li>It shows how complex the graph’s connections are.</li>
            <li>It can be used in real‑world problems like analyzing social networks, recognizing patterns, or comparing different networks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In short, von Neumann entropy gives us a number that tells how complex or disordered a graph is, helping us see patterns and structure in networks.</p>
